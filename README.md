# Moondevs React Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains code for the Moondevs React Assignment. The goal of this assignment is to enhance the readability and modularity of the codebase. 

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure**:

   - Divided the codebase into the following directories:
     - `components/`: Contains all UI components.
     - `hooks/`: Custom hooks for reusable logic.
     - `context/`: Manages stateful logic and provides a centralized state management solution.

2. **Components Directory**:
   - All UI-related components are organized here for better maintainability and readability.
3. **Hooks Directory**:
   - Custom hooks logic is isolated in this directory to reuse logic accross the application.
4. **Context Directory**:
   - Stateful logic that needs to be shared among multiple components is placed in the context directory.
   - While this assignment uses a simple Context API, more complex state management solutions like Redux or Zustand could be integrated.
